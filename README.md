I uploaded the pdf version of the jupyter notebook file just in case it won't open, but according to a quick google search this is what it says:
GitHub: If the .ipynb file is hosted in a GitHub repository, simply navigating to the file in the browser will render the notebook's content for viewing (but not for running the code).
